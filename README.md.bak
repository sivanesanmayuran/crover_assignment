Problem statement: Estimated position and orientation of the car.
Proposal: This is a brand-new problem for me and after the reference I am proposing this issues to solve by Kalman filter algorithm.

The Quaternion conversion can be done using the link below. But I have not performed this math: https://github.com/diegoavillegasg/IMU-GNSS-Lidar-sensor-fusion-using-Extended-Kalman-Filter-for-State-Estimation/blob/master/rotations.py

I have approached the problem and understood the theory behind it. But unable to solve it fully.
